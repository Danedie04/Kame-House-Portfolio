Step 1: Install Dependencies
If you haven't already installed the project dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Run

npm install
This will install all the necessary packages defined in your package.json file.

Step 2: Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

bash
Run

npm start
npm run dev
This command will start the React application, and you should see output in your terminal indicating that the server is running. By default, it will open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Step 3: View Your Application
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 if it doesn't open automatically. You should see your Inventory Management application running.

Step 4: Make Changes and See Live Updates
As you make changes to your code, the development server will automatically reload the application in the browser, allowing you to see your changes in real-time
